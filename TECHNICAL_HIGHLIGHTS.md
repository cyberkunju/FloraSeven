## 📱 User-Centric Dynamic Control

### 6. Remote Configuration Without Firmware Updates
**Adaptive Intelligence**

**Challenge**: Different plants require different care parameters. Traditional systems require firmware reprogramming.

**Solution**: Server-side threshold management with mobile app interface:

**Architecture**:
```
Mobile App → REST API → Server Database → MQTT → Hardware Nodes
     ↓
User sets thresholds
     ↓
Server stores in DB
     ↓
Server logic uses new thresholds
     ↓
Hardware continues sending raw data (unchanged)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Zero Downtime**: No need to reflash firmware
- **Plant-Specific Profiles**: Different thresholds per plant
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Adjust for growth stages
- **Multi-User Support**: Different users, different preferences
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with optimal parameters

**Example Use Case**:
- Seedling stage: High moisture (60-80%), moderate light
- Vegetative stage: Moderate moisture (40-60%), high light
- Flowering stage: Lower moisture (30-50%), very high light

User adjusts thresholds via app → System adapts instantly → No hardware changes.
